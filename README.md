# Legacy VB6 Code Archive

This is some very old Visual Basic 6 (VB6) code I wrote years ago. It’s not actively maintained or intended for reuse, but I’ve kept it here for reference and archival purposes.

If you’re curious or can learn something from it — feel free to dig in. Just be aware that it reflects a much earlier stage of development practices and tooling.

Use at your own discretion.
